# Boston Housing Data

## Getting Started ##

In order to gain a better understanding of the metrics used in regression settings, we will be looking at the Boston Housing dataset.

First use the cell below to read in the dataset and set up the training and testing data that will be used for the rest of this problem.

### Code

Template code is provided in Regression_Metrics.ipynb notebook file and it is divided into ten (10) steps. 

- `Step 1`: Before we get too far, let's do a quick check of the models that you can use in this situation given that you are working on a regression problem. Use the dictionary and corresponding letters below to provide all the possible models you might choose to use.

- `Step 2`: Now for each of the models you found in the previous question that can be used for regression problems, import them using skle

- `Step 3`: Now that you have imported the 4 models that can be used for regression problems, instantate each below.

- `Step 4`: Fit each of your instantiated models on the training data.

- `Step 5`: Use each of your models to predict on the test data.

- `Step 6`: Now for the information related to this lesson.  Use the dictionary to match the metrics that are used for regression and those that are for classification.

- `Step 7`: Similar to what you did with classification models, let's make sure you are comfortable with how exactly each of these metrics is being calculated. We can then match the value to what sklearn provides.

- `Step 8`: Your turn fill in the function below and see if your result matches the built in for mean_squared_error.

- `Step 9`: Now one last time - complete the function related to mean absolute error. Then check your function against the sklearn metric to assure they match.

- `Step 10`: Which model performed the best in terms of each of the metrics? Note that r2 and mse will always match, but the mae may give a different best model. Use the dictionary and space below to match the best model via each metric.
